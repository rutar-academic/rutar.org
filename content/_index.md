{% hidden_link(url="/images/alex.jpg") %}I{% end %} am a maths PhD student at the {% hidden_link(url="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/") %}University of St Andrews, Scotland{% end %} (supervised by {{ person(key="fraser.jonathan-m") }} and {{ person(key="falconer.kenneth-j") }}) in the [analysis group](https://sta-analysis.github.io).
I did my undergraduate studies at the {% hidden_link(url="https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/") %}University of Waterloo, Ontario{% end %}.

I am primarily interested in fractal geometry and dynamical systems, including (but not limited to) the geometry of self-similar and self-affine sets and associated invariant measures, multifractal analysis, and general dimension theory and dimension interpolation.
You can find more information on my [research page](/research/), in my [CV](/alex_rutar_cv.pdf), looking at my [publications](/publications/), or reading my [expository work](/writing/).

In my spare time I develop [open-source software](https://github.com/alexrutar) which mostly centres around tooling, such as a [Vim session manager](https://github.com/alexrutar/vs), [LaTeX templating software](https://github.com/alexrutar/tpr), or an [automatic bibliography generator](https://github.com/alexrutar/mathbib-py).
I also greatly enjoy [cooking](https://food.rutar.org) and [taking photos](https://photography.rutar.org).
