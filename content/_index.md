{% hidden_link(url="/images/alex.jpg") %}I{% end %} am a maths PhD student at the {% hidden_link(url="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/") %}University of St Andrews, Scotland{% end %} (supervised by {{ data_link(key="jmfraser", path="data/people.json", attr="short_name") }} and {{ data_link(key="kjfalconer", path="data/people.json", attr="short_name") }}) in the [analysis group](http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/pg/pure/Analysis/index.html).

I did my undergraduate studies at the {% hidden_link(url="https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/") %}University of Waterloo, Ontario{% end %}.
You can [read my CV](/alex_rutar_cv.pdf) for more detail.

I am primarily interested in fractal geometry and dynamical systems, in particular the geometry of self-similar and self-affine sets in Euclidean space and associated invariant measures.
Find more information on my [research page](/research/).

In my spare time I develop [open-source software](https://github.com/alexrutar) and occasionally I [write about things](/writing/) that interest me.
I also greatly enjoy [cooking](https://food.rutar.org) and [taking photos](https://unsplash.com/@rutarphotography).
