Multifractal analysis is, generally speaking, the study of the regularity properties of a locally rough function.
Such objects typically exhibit very rich local behaviour: for many of the well-studied examples, the level sets of the functions are dense in their support and are often very large (in the sense of Hausdorff dimension) for a continuum of values.

Much of my work has focused on the geometry of overlapping self-similar iterated function systems for the "hard" range of <var>q<0</var>: see for example my [WSC paper](/papers/wsc_multi_R.pdf) or my [multifractal decomposition paper](/papers/fnc_loop_multi.pdf).
I have also worked on the [multifractal analysis of random substitutions](/papers/substitution_multifractal.pdf).
