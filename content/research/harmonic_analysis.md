Many problems in harmonic analysis involve substantial geometric considerations at their core; perhaps one of the most infamous example is the Kakeya conjecture.
One family of problems in which I am particularly interested are 'fractal' versions of classical questions, such as the <var>L<sup>p</sup></var>-improving properties of maximal operators with restricted dilation sets, or generalizations such as local smoothing estimates for the wave equation with time restricted to a fractal subset.
