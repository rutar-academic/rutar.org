The classical case for studying an iterated function system is to "invert" the system and essentially study the associated uniformly expanding dynamical system.
However, when the system is overlapping, no such dynamical analogue exist.
The study of separation conditions is an attempt to give general conditions on the overlapping system which ensures certain properties, and to characterize when the conditions are satisfied.
