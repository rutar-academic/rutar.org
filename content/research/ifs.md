A common construction for fractal sets is to use an *iterated function system*, or *IFS* for short.
One can associate with an IFS an invariant fractal set, as well as a family of invariant measures.
This category includes my work on self-similar and self-affine sets, which includes dimension theory, multifractal analysis, and the study of separation conditions.
