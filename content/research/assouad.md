Assouad-type dimensions are a family of dimensions which capture the “coarsest” scaling properties of a set.
This area has been very active recently, with a large amount of interest in this field from various points of view, such as conformal geometry, embedding theory, and fractal geometry.

In this area, I have proven [classification results for Assouad spectra](/papers/attainable_assouad_spectra.pdf) and studied the Assouad dimension of overlapping self-affine carpets in my [joint paper](/papers/planar_assouad_overlapping.pdf) with {{ person(key="fraser.jonathan-m") }}.
