Dimension classification is concerned with determining the possible forms and configurations of various dimensional quantities, either for general sets or within specific families.

In my joint project with {{ person(key="banaji.amlan") }} we develop general techniques for constructing homogeneous Moran sets, and apply these techniques to [classify the possible forms of intermediate dimensions](/papers/attainable_int_dims.pdf).
Then, using the same techniques along with some new constructions, I obtain [classification results for the Assouad spectra](/papers/attainable_assouad_spectra.pdf) and construct some sets with exceptional properties.
