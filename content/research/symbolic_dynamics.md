Symbolic dynamics generally studies properties of invariant sets and measures which are defined on infinite sequences of characters of a fixed (finite or countably infinite) alphabet.

One example of such a system arises from a *substitution*.
A (deterministic) substitution consists of a finite alphabet along with a set of transformation rules.
A classical example is the Fibonacci substitution, which is composed of the transformations taking <var>a</var> to <var>ab</var> and <var>b</var> to <var>a</var>.
Random substitutions are a generalization of deterministic substitutions where a transformation rule is chosen randomly from a list of rules.
Deterministic and random substitutions have associated dynamical systems and invariant measures, which capture certain "asymptotic statistics" of the substitution.

In my [joint paper](/papers/substitution_multifractal.pdf) with {{ person(key="amitchell") }}, we study the multifractal properties of measure associated with random substitutions.
