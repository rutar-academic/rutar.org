### *Recent updates*
This is the course webpage for the course *fractal geometry and dynamics* taught in Spring 2026.
Any important course updates will be posted here.


### Exercise sheets

- [Exercise 1](fgd-ex-1.pdf) and [Solutions](fgd-sols-1.pdf)
- [Exercise 2](fgd-ex-2.pdf) due 12:15pm Thursday January 22
<!-- - [Exercise 3](fgd-ex-3.pdf) due 12:15pm Thursday January 29 -->
<!-- - [Exercise 4](fgd-ex-4.pdf) due 12:15pm Thursday February 5 -->
<!-- - [Exercise 5](fgd-ex-5.pdf) due 12:15pm Thursday February 12 -->

### Final project information

The final project will be due on Sunday, February 22 at 23:59.
Here is the current list of projects.
I will add more in the next few days if I think of new ones.
The pre-requisite material for these projects should mostly be covered by the midpoint of the course.

- Dimensions of self-affine carpets
- Separation conditions for self-similar sets
- Inhomogeneous self-similar sets
- Assouad dimension and weak tangents
- Multifractal analysis for self-similar measures
- Topological dynamical systems


For detail on the projects, as well as information about the evaluation, see the [information sheet](fgd-final-project.pdf).

### Course material

Here is a [link to the lecture notes](fgd-notes.pdf?v=2026-01-15), last updated on Jan 15, 2026.

I am unfortunately behind schedule with the preparation of lecture notes and they are not finished.
I will update the lecture notes each weekend to cover at least the material for the lectures in the following week.
In order to get the updated notes, please re-visit this page and click on the link again (instead of refreshing the PDF page).

These notes are based on the following references:
- [Self-similar and self-affine sets and measures](https://zbmath.org/1543.28001) by Balázs Bárány, Károly Simon, and Boris Solomyak.
  Email me if you want a PDF copy.
- Mike Hochman's [ergodic theory notes](https://math.huji.ac.il/~mhochman/courses/ergodic-theory-2017/notes.pdf).
- Marcelo Viana's [notes on Rokhlin disintegration](https://w3.impa.br/~viana/out/rokhlin.pdf).
- Gerald Folland's [real analysis textbook](https://apachepersonal.miun.se/~andrli/Bok.pdf).

### Evaluation
This course is scored out of 100, but ultimately the evaluation is pass-fail.

To pass, you require at least 60 points, with a minimum of 25 points on the final project.
The finer breakdown is as follows:

- written exercise solutions (40 points)
- presentation of the exercises during exercise classes (10 points)
- an independent final project with a written (5-10 pages, 25 points) and oral component (45-60 minutes, 25 points).

There will be 5 available bonus points in the exercises which apply to your overall grade.

### Schedule

- Lectures take place from *12:15* to *14:00* on Thursdays and Fridays, starting on January 8 and ending on February 20.
- Exercise classes take place from *14:15* to *16:00* on Thursdays, starting on January 16 and ending on February 20.
- There will be 1 exercise sheet due per week, on January 15, January 22, January 29, Feburary 5, February 12, and February 19.
- There will be a final project, due on February 22, with presentations between February 22 and February 27.
- There will be no exam and the course will end on February 27.

## Course details

### Description
The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to fractal geometry from the perspective of dynamical systems theory.
A particular emphasis is given on objects with some form of *invariance under re-scaling*, such as [self-similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity).

A key intermediate goal is to introduce [dynamical systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), which (for us) is a useful frame of reference for understanding invariance.
This is a ubiquitous tool in analysis, PDEs, geometry, mathematical physics, engineering, ...

Some topics which will be covered:
- *Iterated function systems*
- *Dimension of sets and measures*
- *Measure preserving systems*
- *Ergodic theorems*
- *Conditional measures, Rokhlin disintegration*
- *Exact dimensionality of self-similar measures*
