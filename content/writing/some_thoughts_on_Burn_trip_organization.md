This article contains some general comments about organizing the St Andrews Postgraduate Mathematics Burn trip!
These comments are based on my personal experience being involved in the organization of the trip during in 2022.

If you have any organizational questions or comments about these notes as they slowly become out-of-date, please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:alex@rutar.org).

## General organizational comments
### Timeline
- The Burn trip is typically scheduled for the first week of the academic semester.
  In 2023, the trip has been booked for January 16-18.
- The [main sign-up form](#sign-up-form) should be collected around November 18 (two months in advance).
  Microsoft forms or google forms is a good way to collect this information.
- The [follow-up information](#follow-up-information) should be collected around January 9 (1 week before the trip date).
  Try to get slides and abstracts for the research talks the week leading up to the trip as well.

### Trip Scheduling
- You can find the 2022 trip schedule here: {% verbose_url() %}https://rutar.org/burn2022/{% end %}.
- Typically, breakfast is served from 9am - 10am, lunch from 1pm - 2pm, and dinner from 6:30pm - 8pm.
  Note that this schedule is flexible if required: in particular, on arrival day and departure day, these times can be modified.
- Make sure to leave plenty of buffer time.
  For instance, you might consider having a 30 minute break every 3 talks, which will allow talk overrun to take up some break time.
  Another option would be to be very strict on talk timing and interrupt speakers that run over!
- Typical bus timing is as follows: try to leave from the Mathematical Institute at 1:30pm on Monday, and depart from the Burn at 1:30pm on Wednesday.
  This might be flexible.
  If there is a pickup in Dundee, the drive will take approximately 25 minutes from the Mathematical Institute.
  Make sure everybody is at the departure location 15 minutes in advance in St Andrews and in Dundee.
- Make sure you know how many are travelling on the bus at a given time, to ensure you are not missing anybody!
- On the last day, checkout is around 10:30am.
  Check out of rooms first, and then have talks in the morning on the last day before lunch

### Burn property details
- Most rooms are shared.
  You should pre-arrange room arrangements: the main thing is to check if anybody has preferences and wants a single rooms.
  There are quite a few rooms, so this shouldn't be too hard depending on group size.
    - Note that the room arrangements are flexible and can be easily changed on arrival.
- All meals are covered.
  In addition, there is coffee in the lunch room at all times and usually snacks sitting around.
- There is a library, and a games room on the top floor with table tennis, snooker.
- The WiFi in the main room is decent, but not good enough for video call.
  The library also has good WiFi, but the connection in the rooms is quite spotty.
- The Burn can run a bar in the evenings (approx. student union prices).
  Note that it is not permitted to bring outside alcohol into the Burn.

### Talks
- Bring a controller of some sort, such as a laser pointer with controls for operating slides (Mike Todd has one to borrow, maybe some others).
  Bring extra batteries, just in case!
- Try to get all the talks on a single computer in advance in your preferred format.
  This saves time, since it makes it easy to cycle through talks and ensures compatibility with a controller.
- The room has a projector and a small paper flipboard (bring markers for the flipboard).
  It will be simplest to use the projector, which a small amount of content on the flipboard if requested.
  Note that there is no podium.
- If there are videos, make sure you downloaded the files directly on your computer since the WiFi may not be able to support playback.

## Form details
### Sign-up Form
The sign up form can be easily created on Microsoft Forms or Google Docs.
You should request the following information:
- name
- email	
- research group (good for arranging talks to have variety)
- dietary requirements
- bus transport (from Mathematical Institute / Dundee)
- research talk? (get group talks: 20 mins + 10 mins flex, and research talks (15 mins + 5 mins flex)

### Follow-up Information
- for people giving talks: get titles, abstracts, etc.
- determine room booking requests

## Other thoughts
### Non-math things to do
- Go for a walk up some nearby hills.
- Walk to Edzell.
- Go by the castle near Edzell.
- Wander the grounds.
- Games room on 3rd floor.

### Miscellaneous comments
- Take a lot of pictures! (We didn't take enough.)
- Pre-schedule a group photo, and make sure to take it.
- Try to get a burn contact in case you have questions about the Burn house.
