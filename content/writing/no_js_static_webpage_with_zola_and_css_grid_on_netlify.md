I enjoy things that are _minimally functional_:
In this article, I will describe the process that I undertook to set up the site that this article is currently hosted on.
This is subdivided into three essentially disjoint subtopics, and mildly unrelated, subtopics:

- Responsive design with CSS Grid
- Static site generation with Zola
- Hosting on Netlify

## CSS Grid: Easy Responsive Design

## Zola: Static Site Generation

## Netlify: Web Hosting for Static Sites
I like

- Netlify .toml management
  - create CSP, etc.
  - everything is canonical
- zola builds are really fast
- CSS grid is awesome (no complex frameworks)

problems
- hard to extend zola (need to recompile binary - and then it is not supported by netlify CI)
