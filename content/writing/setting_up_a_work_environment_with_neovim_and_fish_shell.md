In a [previous post](@/from_vim_and_tmux_to_neovim.md), I talked about migrating to a [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) setup for my work environment.
I also recently started using [fish](https://fishshell.com/), which is an interesting alternative to the usual bash or zsh.
In this article, I will specifically discuss my setup when editing LaTeX documents.
